# BasicRPG-BattleSimulator

- Currently, it features basic combat mechanics and is designed to be easily extensible.
- 3 classes (referred to here as "races") are available: Mage, Warrior and Elf, each with their own attributes.
- The game is entirely based on luck. The numbers and stats are randomly generated based on each class's attributes.

1. Features:
- Basic turn-based combat between characters.
- Randomized attack and defense calculations.
- Simple character stats system (health, attack, defense).
- Console-based interface for easy testing.

2. How to Run:
- Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/BrunoRobbVictor11/BasicRPG-BattleSimulator.git
- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (NetBeans, IntelliJ, VSCode).
- Compile and run the main class (Main.java).
- Follow the console prompts to simulate battles.

3. Installation:
- Requires Java JDK 8 or higher.
- No additional libraries are needed.

4. More Info:
- The player can choose from 4 menu options during combat:
- Attack – perform a standard attack on the enemy, based on a dice roll (using the character's attributes).
- Defense – reduce incoming damage from the enemy's attack, based on a dice roll (using the character's attributes).
- Pray – restores +50 HP for the player and cancels the enemy's attack if their dice roll results in a 6.
- Skip – skip the turn without taking any action.

5. Roadmap:
- Add more character classes and abilities.
- Implement items and equipment.
- Add experience points and leveling system.
- Improve battle mechanics with skills and magic.
